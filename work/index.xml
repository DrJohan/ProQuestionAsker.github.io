      <description>Read the Story • Download the Data  The Premise Since the invention of the chocolate chip cookie, the original recipe has been altered and amended in attempts to make the recipe more gooey, chocolatey, and generally tastier than its predecessors. Is there a way to leverage computers and hundreds of existing cookie recipes to generate the most average recipe? Perhaps, like averaging human faces, the average cookie recipe could be the most delicious of them all.</description>

      <description>Read the Story • Download the Data  The Premise When you love the city where you live, you often have personal connections and memories tied to the different corners of the city’s limits. In this story, we wanted to combine our personal experiences in Seattle and New York City’s neighborhoods, with data about the businesses that operate in those neighborhoods. Do we have different perceptions of areas with an overabundance of massage parlors than we do to an area with a ton of doctors?</description>

      <description>Read the Story • Download the Data  The Premise I discovered that the Curiosity Rover transmitted weather data (amongst other types of data) back to Earth nearly every day. I decided that in order to have the reader understand what weather conditions are like on Mars, the data needed to be made personal. With Curiosity as my inspiration, I wrote the story from the rover’s perspective in the form of digital “postcards”.</description>

      <description>Read the Story  The Premise For some people in the US, round-trip travel time to the nearest abortion-providing clinic can be about nine hours. We set out to quantify access to abortion clinics by measuring what really affects people: how long it takes to drive there.

      <description>Read the Story  The Premise Americans are beginning to spend more of their mealtimes solo. What does that look like for the US as a community of people? We explore the data surrounding the dining habits and companions of Americans.

      <description>Read the Story • Download the Data  The Premise Around the world, people seem to have mixed feelings about whales and dolphins that live in aquariums. While it may be easy (and for some people even preferable) to say that the solution is to release all of the animals back to the ocean, their past makes it more difficult. In this story, we explore the data of where captive whales and dolphins in the US came from, their survival rate, and the projected timing of extinction for these animals in a captive setting.</description>

      <description>Read the Story • Download the Data  The Premise Every time there is some sort of large scale storm (e.g., blizzard or hurricane) or big sports win, I seem to hear everyone chatting about how there will be a baby boom in that area 9 months later. Driven by the curiosity to see if there was any data to back up these claims, I decided to investigate a little further.</description>

      <description>Read the Story  The Premise There have been several projects conducted that show a disparity in film dialogue between male and female characters. But, talking isn’t the only thing important to a movie. The way characters are instructed to act plays a role as well. In this project, we investigate over 2,000 film scripts to find what verbs are more likely to follow the pronouns “he” and “she”.
 My Contributions  Some front-end development (HTML, CSS, and D3)   Collaborators The data collection, analysis, graphic wireframes, and story-writing for this project came from Julia Silge.</description>
